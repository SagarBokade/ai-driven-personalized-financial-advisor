System Architecture of AI-Driven Personalized Financial Advisor

1. Overview:
    The system architecture of the AI-driven personalized financial advisor is designed to ensure efficient interaction between users, the backend server, and the AI model. It provides a seamless experience by integrating natural language processing (NLP) capabilities with a user-friendly web interface.

2. Components of the Architecture

    A. Frontend
        Purpose: Provides an interactive user interface for inputting financial queries and viewing advice.
        Technologies Used:
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the chatbot interface.
            Responsive design for compatibility with different devices.
        Features:
            Time-based greetings (e.g., "Good Morning").
            Text input box for user queries.

    B. Backend
        Purpose: Processes user queries and generates responses by interacting with the AI model.
        Technologies Used:
            Flask framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
            Python for backend logic and API communication.
        Core Functions:
            Receive user input from the frontend.
            Formulate prompts for the AI model.
            Clean and format responses before sending them back to the frontend.

    C. Large Language Model (LLM)
        Purpose: Generates personalized financial advice.
        Model Used: Hugging Face's Phi-3.5-mini-instruct.
        Integration:
            The model is accessed via APIs provided by Hugging Face.
            Token-based authentication ensures secure communication.

    D. APIs
        Purpose: Enables interaction between the backend and external services.
        Key Roles:
            Fetching real-time financial data (if implemented).
            Communicating with the LLM for query processing.

    E. Database (Optional for future enhancements):
        

3. Workflow:
Step 1: User Interaction
    The user accesses the chatbot interface through a web browser.
    They input a financial query (e.g., "What are good stocks to invest in?").

Step 2: Query Processing
    The backend receives the query and processes it using Flask.
    A structured prompt is created for the AI model to ensure relevant advice generation.

Step 3: LLM Response Generation:
    The backend sends the prompt to the LLM via the Hugging Face API.
    The LLM analyzes the query, generates a response, and sends it back to the backend.

Step 4: Response Delivery:
    The backend cleans the generated response for clarity and relevance.
    The advice is displayed on the frontend for the user to review.

4. Scalability and Future Enhancements:
    Current Design:
        Supports text-based queries with real-time responses.
        Scalable to handle multiple users concurrently.
    Future Additions:
        Integration of real-time financial data APIs for updated advice.
        Database support for personalized advice history.
        Graphical visualization of financial data.
